You are sailing on the small skiff as the sun dips below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the water.
The boat is gently rocking with the rhythm of the waves. The fortress island, with its imposing stone walls and watchful towers, gradually recedes into the distance.
You can't help but feel a mixture of relief and anticipation as you embark on this new journey. 

As the sun goes down you start to feel a bit chilly. You shiver in the cool evening breeze. 
You start looking around among the Marlowe’s things and find a soft woolen scarf of superb quality. 
You check the label and it reads ‘Acne Studios’. '
“Damn...” you think
“that old pirate has some excellent taste”. 
You wrap the scarf around your shoulders, and you feel an immediate sense of comfort and warmth.
"""

reset_stats_and_stuff = """As the skiff glides smoothly over the water, the salty sea air fills your lungs. 
The fresh air seems to clear the fog from your mind, and you feel your hangover lifting. 
Your health improves, and a newfound strength courses through your veins."""

enter_the_harbor = """
The sound of waves lapping against the hull gradually gives way to the cacophony of the harbor.
As you draw closer, the scale of the port becomes apparent. Ships of all shapes and sizes are docked along the piers.
The salty sea air carries with it a mixture of scents: the sharp tang of fresh fish, the rich aroma of exotic spices, and the earthy smell of damp wood. 

The harbor is alive with activity. Sailors shout orders and greetings, their voices mingling with the clatter of crates being loaded and unloaded, while haggle animatedly over prices. 
You step onto the cobblestone streets, worn smooth by countless footsteps. 
The sounds of seagulls crying overhead and the distant murmur of a bustling market reach your ears, painting a picture of life in this vibrant city.

From your vantage point, you can already see the market teeming with people, a popular inn standing proudly at its edge. 
Next to the inn, a shadowy alleyway beckons. 
With a sense of excitement and curiosity, you take your first steps into the Port of Amsterdam, ready to explore all it has to offer.
"""

apothecary_shop_entrance = """
As the music crescendos, the mural of the moomin troll on the wall starts to glow.
The painted eyes of the troll open and wink at you, the colors in the mural swirling as it comes to life.
The image begins to shift and distort, the bricks start shifting as if to open an entrance for you.

With one final powerful note, the transformation completes, revealing the archway to a hidden apothecary shop.
The ancient wooden door creaks open and a faint, mysterious aroma wafts out.
"""

fuzzy_bear_gossip = """
The player has just flirted with you for a bit and now you feel like gossiping.
You talk about two other patrons that are present in the inn. Here is some information about them (feel free to add on a little bit)
    
1) Sven the Bard, who is admittedly quite handsome if you don't think about the braids.
He probably has more knowledge about magical society than he lets on.
He also does have a tendency to make everything about the nordic countries.
MOST IMPORTANTLY: HE LOVES RABBIT STEW, IF YOU NEED HIM FOR SOMETHING THIS IS HANDY INFO
    
2) Françoise the Ranger, who is at least equally handsome.
The most important gossip here is that, even though she is a ranger, nobody ever sees her eat meat.
The only thing she seems to enjoy are sweets and pastries. 
She might be a vegetarian."""
